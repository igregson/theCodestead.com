title: Birth of The Codestead
---

Here's to the obligatory first post. The post to stake-out initial intentions and potential directions.

### The Idea

For a long time I've been hearing, thinking, and telling myself to start a developer blog. A place to share the things I'm learning as I create things on the web.  

But for some reason I always hesitated. Why?

1. [Imposture syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome)
2. Wondering if I could invest the necessary time and energy

### The Mental Switch 

I listen to a lot of podcasts. It's a convenient way to feel productive (without actually doing anything). One such listening (while doing some home renovation work, might I add) motivated me to finally start. It was [this Developer Tea](https://developertea.com/episodes/7976) episode, an interview with author of [Simple Programmer](http://simpleprogrammer.com/), John Sonmez, effectively encouraging developer folks to write about their learnings and offer them to the world. 

### The Name

I didn't want a blog at myname.com. Seems better to create something beyond myself. 

When reading *The Codestead* folks likely either smile or scratch heads.  

##### What's a Codestead? 

A *codestead* is like a homestead, only for coders (and virtual, of course).

##### What does this mean? 

Though it's certainly no longer the 1990's, I still tend think of the web as a modern-day "wild west" of sorts. US history is filled with examples of folks "going west." Often they settled on homesteads, near-self-sufficient harbors of rogue and royal alike. Homestead's are places for jacks-and-jills-of-all-trades who are also "masters of some".
