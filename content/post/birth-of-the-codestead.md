Here's to the obligatory first post. The post that explains the big idea, at
least here in the beginning.

### The Idea

For a long time I've been hearing and even telling myself to start a blog. Well, this is it. Only instead of using myname.com as the platform, I'm attempting to create something "Beyond myself."

### The Name

Chances are, you either smile or scratch your head at the site's title. Perhaps you're asking "what's a *codestead*."

A *codestead* is like a homestead, only for coders (and virtual, of course).

###### What does this mean? 

Though it's certainly no longer the 1990's, I still think of the web as a modern-day "wild west" of sorts. US history is filled with examples of folks "going west" and steaking their claims. Often, they created homestead (Abraham Lincoln's homeplace being one of countless examples). Homestead's are places for jacks-of-all-trades. 




### Hasn't this been done before?

Lots of questions go through one's mind before beginning a new project. For web projects, one of the big ones is "hasn't this been done before?" And if something's been done before, why do it again? 

There's something that feels almost inherintly wrong with "recreating the wheel." If I'm camping with friends and someone's already built a fire, the last thing I'm likely to do is build *another* one. Yet, industry and individuals are guilty of "wheel-recreating" nearly every day. If we weren't, there'd be no Toyota (Ford existed first), no bicycle (there was already the tricycle), and no Twitter (there was already Facebook).

So there are obvious reasons to do something that's already been done:

- variety (same idea, different execution)
- innovation (idea morphing)
- perspective

For products, the simple idea is that "this may have already been done, but I/we want to improve it" or "I/we want to do it differently." Straightforward, right? 

For information-based websites, there's great value in variety and perspective. Just like books. If all authors were affraid of re-creating the wheel, libraries would be much smaller (if they'd exist at all).

### Mostly for Me

Ever heard a teach say that he/she learns so much more than they teach? I sure
have. And it's really true.
