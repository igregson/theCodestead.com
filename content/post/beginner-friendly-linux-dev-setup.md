<!-- When I first began writing code I worked on a Windows 7 machine. It's true. I wasn't one of the cool mac-kinds. When seeing macs I was of course intrigued. Usually they frustrated me. "Why can't I delete this file!" "Where the right click button!" And many other thoughts came to mind whenever I'd fumble around on macs of friends or family members. 

But I wasn't exactly happy on Windows either. Certainly, I "power-used" the heck out of it, complete with tons of customized keyboard shortcuts and "extended-feature" apps. But then came "the shell."

Linux isn't (only) for geeks. In the past it may have been, but times have changed. With the right Linux flavor ("distro," in Linux terms) it's easy to have a powerful and user-friendly development machine.

I've been using Linux as my primary work machine for well over a year now. For those in search of a better shell (Windows users) or something closer to most production environments (Mac users), here's my 2 cents.

## Choose the right distro
