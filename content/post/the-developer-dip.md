Seth Godin articulates an important concept of "the dip" in his book *[The Dip][http://amzn.to/19EM2Nn]*. If you haven't read it, think "learning curve" or "barrier of entry". But it's more than that. It's the thing that separates the novices from the pros. It's the thing standing between you and becoming "the best in the world" at whatever it is you're aspiring to. 

There's a lot of value to unpack in Godin's concept for those in (or entering) the world of web development.

### Getting Started is Easy

Getting started as a "web dev" doesn't take much. 

Initially, I'd argue that all seeking a path in web development should at least be familiar with the front-end bread-and-butter skills (html, css, and js). Lots of tutorials and courses aimed at beginners go something like this:

- download sublime or another easy but powerful editor
- download html5 boiler plate
- add-in bootstrap
- wire up styles and scripts
- start changing stuff, experiment, break stuff, build something

This is of course an over simplification. But the point remains: the barrier of basic front-end skill is pretty darn low. Certainly, learning to do the above *really well* isn't easy. But learning to "do it and make something decent" isn't so hard. 

This isn't "the dip" that Godin speaks of. 

### Getting through "the dip" is HARD

Why? Because staying at this point doesn't take one very far. Remember, "the dip" is the thing to get through that will make you "the best in the world." It's the thing that'll separate your career from that of the rookie who only builds sites for family members and friends. 

> So what's "the dip" that those seeking to be *really good developers* need to get through? And doesn't it depend on which particular realm of web dev one's interested in? 

To my younger self, and anyone else who might benefit from it, here's my take on "the developer dip", roughly in some type of helpful order (of course the learning process for these things isn't really sequential, and it's certainly dynamic): 

- Javascript without jQuery (at least the basic dom manipulation stuff)
- intimate familiarity with at least one text editor
- the command line (at least a minimal working knowledge)
- system configuration/know-how 
    - giving your system an ssh identity
    - being able to connect to things via ssh
    - knowing how to add things to "the path"
    - having a shell that works the way you'd like it to
    - understanding of user permissions and roles (this arguably doesn't apply to some folks, but I still think it's an important thing to understand)
- pre-processors 
- a build tool (GUIs like Codekit, Prepos and the others are great, but I think it's important to also know how to harness something like Grunt, Gulp, NPM, make, or any of the many others for being able to perform bulid tasks)
- git 
- deployment
- dns setup/management
- ability to follow naming conventions (since these can vary between projects and teams, it's fine and even good to have your own, but it's also important to be able to learn and follow others)
- ability to work without any frameworks. Don't get me wrong, frameworks can be great, but they add abstraction. Skills built on abstraction without fundamental understanding are brittle -- brittle things easily break. So use Bootstrap if that's your thing, but know how to create awesome styles and user experiences without it. 
- able to execute (link here to execute book)
- able to "rock out" at least one CMS
- having a collection of starting points (forked or home-grown) to quickly start
any project.
