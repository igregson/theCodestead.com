summary: Why not bring Jade-goodness to Markdown?
title: Jade-style Classes and IDs in Markdown
---

**TL;DR:**  
I love the ease of adding classes and ids to html elements with Jade and similar HTML pre-processors (HAML, Ace, etc). 

I also love Markdown. 

Idea: Combine the two. 

**The Problem:**  
There's no standard way to add classes and IDs to HTML elements via Markdown. Yes, yes... I know, one can simply write HTML *inside* of Markdown &ndash; but this feels clumsy and somehow "just not good enough." There has to be a better way.

Jade has the `:markdown` filter. This isn't what I'm talking about. I'm not envisioning something with Jade. Rather, I'm envisioning a specific approach *inspired by Jade's syntax* to solving this age-old problem in Markdown.

**Lots of smart folks are working on this:**
